Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and knowledge:

C++ Knowledge: A basic understanding of C++ programming is required.
Visual Studio: You should have Visual Studio installed to work with this project. If you don't have it, you can download it here.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-system-learning.git
Open the project in Visual Studio.

Build and run the project.

Project Structure
The project's directory structure looks like this:

perl
Copy code
file-system-learning/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp        # Contains the main application code
│   ├── User.cpp        # User registration and management code
│   └── User.h          # User class header file
│
└── README.md           # This documentation file
How it Works
This project simulates a user registration process. Here's how it works:

When you run the application, it prompts you to enter a username and password.
The entered credentials are then checked to see if the user already exists in the system.
If the user does not exist, a new user file is created, storing the username and password.
If the user already exists, you will receive an error message when trying to register.
Usage
Build and run the application in Visual Studio.

Follow the prompts to register a new user. Enter a username and password.

If the registration is successful, a new user file will be created in the project directory.

If the user already exists, you will receive an error message.

Experiment with the code, make modifications, and learn more about file system operations in C++.
