File System Learning Project in C++
Overview
This project is designed to help you learn about file systems in C++ by implementing a basic user registration system. By following this project, you will gain insights into working with files, managing user data, and creating a simple C++ application using Visual Studio.

Getting Started -
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-system-learning.git
Open the project in Visual Studio.

Build and run the project.

Project Structure -
The project's directory structure looks like this:

perl
Copy code
file-system-learning/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp        # Contains the main application code
│   ├── Login and Registration System.cpp        # User registration and management code
│   └──Users.txt     # User Registration Name and Passwords
│
└── README.md           # This documentation file

How it Works -
This project simulates a user registration process. Here's how it works:

When you run the application, it prompts you to enter a username and password.
The entered credentials are then checked to see if the user already exists in the system.
If the user does not exist, a new user file is created, storing the username and password.
If the user already exists, you will receive an error message when trying to register.

Usage -
Build and run the application in Visual Studio.

Follow the prompts to register a new user. Enter a username and password.

If the registration is successful, a new user file will be created in the project directory.

If the user already exists, you will receive an error message.

Experiment with the code, make modifications, and learn more about file system operations in C++.
